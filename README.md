# Code Refactor Starter Code
My main objectives for this code was to focus on accessibility as well as making the code easier to read. 
<br />
In order to make the code easier to read I: <br />
-Replaced the div elements with semantic html elements.<br />
-Added comments throughout the CSS file to seperate sections & describe certain elements function.<br />
-Consolidated redundant class elements css into one line.<br />
<br />
Made website more accessible by: <br />
-Replaced "website" title with "Horiseon SSS, Inc." in the tab of the webpage that way users who have multiple tabs open know which tab is our website. <br />
-Added alt attributes into the image src lines so anyone who visits the website can know what the images represent. <br />
<br />
Below I included the live URL link to access the webpage.
